1. When the application is running on multiple servers, then the configurations(maintained in properties file) gets difficult
   to maintain when just few properties are changed, A new release needs to happen.
   
2. Using this application just put properties/configuration in the common database and read all the properties on serevr startup

3. Override configurations can also be maintained. 

4. Just plugin the jar and move to centralised configuration.
